  FBTFT
=========

Linux Framebuffer drivers for small TFT LCD display modules.
The module 'fbtft' makes writing drivers for some of these displays very easy.

This branch is forked from https://github.com/notro/fbtft/
And add support for HummingBoard to use Adafruit PiTFT.

INSTALLATION
(to use PiTFT on HummingBoard)

  Download kernel sources
   tree   : https://github.com/n-aizu/linux-imx6.git
   branch : boundary-wand-imx_3.10.17_1.0.2_ga-rt

  cd drivers/video
  git clone https://github.com/n-aizu/fbtft.git
  cd fbtft
  git checkout imx6-hummingboard

  Add to drivers/video/Kconfig:   source "drivers/video/fbtft/Kconfig"
  Add to drivers/video/Makefile:  obj-y += fbtft/

  Copy fbtft/dts/imx6qdl-hummingboard-pitft[35].dtsi to arch/arm/boot/dts/
  Add to arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6[dl|q]-hummingboard.dts: #include "imx6qdl-hummingboard-pitft.dtsi" or #include "imx6qdl-hummingboard-pitft35.dtsi"
  (If your PiTFT is rev.A, enable ili9340 and disable ili9341 in imx6qdl-hummingboard-pitft.dtsi)

  Enable drivers in menuconfig and build the kernel
  (fbtft, stmpe and stmpe-ts)
